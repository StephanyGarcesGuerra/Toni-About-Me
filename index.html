        <h3 class="root-title">My Roots</h3>
        <p>Born and raised in the outskirts of Atlanta, Georgia has always been home for meâ€”except for a brief two-year adventure in Texas during high school. Those formative years away taught me to appreciate my Southern roots while opening my eyes to different perspectives. </p>

        <h3 class="family-title"> Family: My Greatest Joy & Inspiration </h3>
        <p>As a mom to two wonderful girls, my family is the center of my universe. We garden together, cook together, and grow together. Every day brings new opportunities to build strong relationships and create lasting memories. I believe that these everyday moments are the building blocks of a happy childhood and a connected family.</p>

        <h3 class="work-title"> My Work </h3>
        <p>As a preschool program director, I have the privilege of shaping early childhood experiences that will last a lifetime. My work philosophy is deeply influenced by Frederick Douglass's wisdom: "It's easier to build strong children than to fix broken men."</p>
